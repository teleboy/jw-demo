    <b>Issue:</b> When returning from fullscreen, the controls are not switches into small-player-controls in jwplayer <b>7.9.0 beta</b>
    <br><br>
    <b>Reproduction steps:</b><br /> 
    - Start playing a video file in a small-sized player<br />
    - Go into fullscreen mode <br />
    - Exit fullscreen mode by hitting "Esc" key<br />
    <br><br>
    <b>Expected behavior:</b> The controls should switch automatically to the small-player-controls, when hitting the "Escape" key to leave fullscreen mode.
    <br><br>
    <b>Actual outcome:</b> The controls do not switch back to small-player-controls when returning from fullscreen by hitting the "Esc" key. It works though as expected by clicking the button on the controls.
