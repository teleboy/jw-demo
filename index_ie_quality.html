    <b>Issue:</b> On Edge browser (tested on Microsoft Edge 38.14393.0.0) the Quality does not switch up in html5 mode until fullscreen has been entered or the stream has been paused/resumed
    <br><br>
    <b>Reproduction steps:</b><br /> 
    - Start a hls stream on the Edge browser in html5 mode - The quality stays low forever<br />
    - Switch into fullscreen mode or press pause followed by resume - the quality immediately switches up<br />
    <br><br>
    <b>Expected behavior:</b> The quality should increase automatically.
    <br><br>
    <b>Actual outcome:</b> The quality only switches up when entering fullscreen mode or pause/resume is clicked.
